## About SurFriends
Surfriends is a twitter like social media web app with the porpuse of finding new surf friends and share ideas about surfing.

## Main Features
I created the basic features of a social media app.

### Profile
Each user has a profile with proper authentication with email and password for login and logout, users can also upload his profile picture and also edit all information at any time. The profile also stores and show stats of the user.

The User also can access other users profile to check their stats, posts and follow them.

### Posts and Feed
The main features of the page it's the **Posts and Feed**.

Each user can create **Posts** to share his thoughts to other users, the user can delete his own posts at any time.

The **Feed** shows all other users posts also in order of creation in the Home Page.

### Follow and Unfollow

Like any social media I implemented a way to create a connection with other users by **follow and unfollow** feature. After following another user, his posts will appear now in your feed. The user can also unfollow the user at anytime. 

In each user profile there is also a link to the list of the people he is following and his followers.

A list of users that you're not following yet will appear in your home page as suggestion for you to follow them.

When visiting other user profile, also it shows a list of the users that are following him.
